NC-DCNN

Non Conformance - Deep Convolutional Neural Network. 

Image processing model is trained, tested and validated using "Project 2 Data" which includes labelled data for cracks, missing heads (for screws) and delamination of paint.

PLEASE NOTE
- Ignore Steps1-4-FAIL, these models trained very slow on different hardware and eventually I made a new file on my laptop which replaced my Steps1-4 work.

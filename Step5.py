"Step  5: Model Testing"
"----------------------------------------------------------------------------"

#Test the model that was trained 

#Data processing of test image to convert image to same format as input of model 
    #use image package by Keras 
    #load image 
    #convert image to array 
    #normalize it by dividing image by 255 
    
#find maximum propability from models prediction 
#final prediction of image is expected to look like fig3
